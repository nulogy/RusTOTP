/// This implementation of HMAC-Based One Time Passwords proceeds in three
/// stages, as per [RFC 4226](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4226.txt):
///
/// 1. Generate an HMAC-SHA-1 value given a shared secret `key` and a
/// moving factor `counter` that *should* change on every use
/// 2. Extraction of a 4-byte value from the SHA-1 digest
/// 3. Deriving a final HOTP value between 0 and
/// 10^{`desired_code_length`}-1 from the 4-byte value extracted
/// in the last step.
///
/// Note that it is the responsibility of the caller to:
///
/// * Fulfill the precondition that `counter` is an 8-byte value
/// * Increment the counter accordingly per invocation
///
/// # Examples
///
/// To generate an HOTP value between 0 and 10^8 - 1, given the shared
/// secret ASCII key `"Hello world!"` and current counter `0`:
///
/// ```
/// rusthotp::hotp(8, "Hello world!".as_bytes(), &[0; 8]);
/// ```
